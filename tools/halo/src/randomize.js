/**
 * Randomisation of the effect only.
 *
 * The whole of section 01 is off limits: the text, the font, its size,
 * tracking, leading, alignment, case and ink. Typesetting is the part of
 * the poster the user has actually authored, and rerolling it means every
 * shuffle hands back a different piece of work rather than a different
 * treatment of the same one. The type stays put and the heat around it
 * changes.
 *
 * Canvas format, export height, duration and the interaction mode are held
 * for the same reason — they are output setup, not look.
 *
 * Ranges below are narrower than the sliders allow. The sliders have to
 * reach the extremes so the tool can be pushed; a randomiser that visits
 * them mostly produces unusable frames, and one that mostly produces
 * unusable frames stops being worth pressing. Each band was taken from the
 * part of the range that still reads as type.
